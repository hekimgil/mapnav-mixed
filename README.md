##CENG315 - Project: Map-based navigation

This is a project to provide a **map-based navigation system for personal photo collections**. At its initialization, the project is designed to have a mobile app and a web site part. The user will be able to take pictures (or add previously taken pictures) to a collection. Collections will be clustered according to geographic locations (as extracted from the geo-tagging of the photos) and possibly by time.

The web site part of this project is carried out by **Team YeaH!**, consisting of Yeter Çatıkkaş, Reyhan Özdoğan, and Hakan Hekimgil.

Currently, the web site for the project resides at <a href="http://mapnav.heroku.com/" target="_blank">mapnav.heroku.com</a>.
